He is an amazingly fast learner,picking up new specifications or methodologies in last-minute project changes and challenges. This has lead to him extending his reach beyond the role of network administrator and into areas of software developments and systems administration concurrently. He always is willing to expand and will always at least try to fix a problem before escalating, and when he does, he provides the necessary information to make the associated job a simple task to process.
